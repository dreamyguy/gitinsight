> Visualise your git log in new and exciting ways!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreamyguy/gitinsight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreamyguy/gitinsight) [![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight/blob/master/LICENSE) [![Data generated by Gitlogg](https://img.shields.io/badge/data_generated_by-gitlogg-89336e.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitlogg) [![Data served by Gitlogg API](https://img.shields.io/badge/data_served_by-gitlogg--api-89336e.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitlogg-api)

This project is a natural sequel to [Gitlogg][6], a project that parses the `git log` of multiple repositories into `JSON`. The idea is to help organizations visualize their data in ways that help them understand what lies behind their codebase.

This project relies on [Gitlogg API][7] to render data. Accessing data locally (as originally done until version [v1.0.3](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight/tree/v1.0.3)) would hit a wall as browsers only cache a limited amount of data. It was also important to outsource the _massaging_ of the data to a dedicated service, as too many operations had to be made to show even the simplest output. Now these operations are done at the `API`.

Since this project relies on [Gitlogg API][7], which in turn relies on the output generated by [Gitlogg][6], these projects are all interconnected. :revolving_hearts:

## Installing

This project requires you to run `npm install` from the project's root. It requires [NodeJS][4] to be previously installed in your system.

If you're new to [Gulp][2] you might want to install it globally:

```shell
$ npm install gulp-cli -g
```

## Running it

Once installation is complete, you can start the server with hot-reloading (refresh upon file save) with:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```

The server will be available on `localhost:3000`

## License

Free to use it AS IS as long as you stick to the [MIT license](LICENSE).

#### Release History

* 2018-04-08   [v2.0.0](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight/tree/v2.0.0) - [View Changes](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight/compare/v1.0.3...v2.0.0)
  * Total overhaul! :sparkles: :tada:
  * Introduction of React
  * Use of an API as data source (through [gitlogg-api](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitlogg-api)) instead of accessing local data, which was costly and not scalable.
  * Unit testing
  * Travis CI
