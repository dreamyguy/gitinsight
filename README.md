This project is a natural sequel to [Gitlogg][6], a project that parses the `git log` of multiple repositories into `JSON`. The idea is to help organizations visualize their data in ways that help them understand what lies behind their codebase.

**Note**: The React implementation is under development!

## Installing

This project requires you to run `npm install` from the project's root. It requires [NodeJS][4] to be previously installed in your system.

If you're new to [Gulp][2] you might want to install it globally:

```shell
$ npm install gulp-cli -g
```

## Running it

Once installation is complete, you can start the server with hot-reloading (refresh upon file save) with:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```

The server will be available on `localhost:3000`

## License

Free to use it AS IS as long as you stick to the [MIT license](LICENSE).
